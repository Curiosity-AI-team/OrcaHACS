Based on your explanation, the Python client needs to:

Send periodic data (like battery status, logs, errors, etc.) to the orca_bridge endpoint, which then passes that information to Home Assistant.
Allow communication of text between the client and Home Assistant's conversation agent via the /receive_text endpoint.
Enable two-way communication where the client can send text and receive feedback via the Home Assistant UI.
To implement this, we need to:

Ensure the Python client sends periodic data such as battery status and logs to Home Assistant.
The Home Assistant side (orca_bridge) needs to receive that data and store it or display it in the UI.
We also need the bidirectional text communication through the conversation.process service, where the client can send a message, and Home Assistant can send back a response that the client will receive.
